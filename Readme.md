GETTING STARTED
==============

CartoDB is a geospatial database on the cloud that allows for the storage and visualization of data on the web. Using CartoDB will allow you to quickly create map based visualizations. Here are a few ways you can use CartoDB.

* Upload, visualize, and manage your data using the [authoring tool][cartodb_login].
* Quickly create and customize maps that you can embed or share via public URL using the map embedding tool.
* Analyze, and integrate data you store on CartoDB into your applications using the [SQL API][sql_api].
* For more advance integrations of CartoDB maps on your website or application, use [Cartodb.js][cartodb_js]


Main reasons to use CartoDB
--------------

#### Secure data storage
We provide secure and safe storage of your data. In all accounts, your data is yours to write and modify (take a look at authentication for further info). In all subscription level accounts, we also provide the ability to host private tables, where you will be the only person able to read the data. On top of read and write security, CartoDB offers data backup services at every level of hosting. That means your data will be there every time you log-in, no question.

#### Develop applications
CartoDB provides a powerful data management and geospatial analysis backend for your application. Among many features, CartoDB includes a Maps API that provides projected map tiles for you to create fast data visualization, and the SQL API that allows you to query your data, or through secure connection, write new data to your CartoDB tables.

#### Analyze data
CartoDB gives you access to a PostGIS enabled PostgreSQL database containing your data. These geospatially enabled databases not only give you complete control of your data, but a suite of tools with limitless potential for analyzing your data. PostgresSQL and PostGIS are both open-source projects developed independently of CartoDB, their documentation pages are very helpful for unleashing CartoDB’s full potential. Also, be sure to check out some of our Galleries for inspiration!

#### Scalable distribution and storage
Using CDN technology, maps created with CartoDB get distributed over a network of edge locations all around the world. That ensure maximum speed and reliability when handling large amounts of request. CartoDB works with 10 views per day or 10 million views per day. You can’t always be certain the scale of your project before you get started. CartoDB storage is easily scalable, allowing you to upgrade your account seamlessly at any point in time. Check-out the pricing page to see the difference in CartoDB accounts and see which ones fits your needs right now.

#### CartoDB is open source
The team behind CartoDB have a strong commitment to Open Source. Even before the development of CartoDB, we have used, contributed to, and created many open-source projects. With CartoDB, we have continued that tradition. We have built the tool on a stack of some of our favorite open-source technologies, including, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Mapnik, and our very own WindShaft. CartoDB is no different, you can find the code in our git repository.
So why use our service? With CartoDB comes a cadre of information technology specialists and developers that help keep your data running, secure, and available in the cloud. We also offer seamless account upgrades and always keep your data hosted on the latest CartoDB release.
