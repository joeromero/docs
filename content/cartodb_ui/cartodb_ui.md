# What is CartoDB

CartoDB is a tool to create map visualizations on the web. It features a geospatial database on the cloud that allows for the storage and visualization of data in your browser. Using CartoDB will allow you to quickly create map based visualizations. Here are a few ways you can use CartoDB:

* Upload, visualize, and manage your data using our web interface. Start at your [CartoDB dashboard][cartodb_login].

* Quickly create and customize maps that you can embed or share via public URL using the map embedding options.

* Analyze and integrate data you store on CartoDB into your applications using the [SQL API][sql_api].

* Create advanced integrations of CartoDB maps on your website or application using [CartoDB.js][cartodb_js]

# 1 minute introduction

Your dashboard has two main sections: **tables** and **visualizations**. The steps to create a visualization of your data are simple: 

1. Import your data
2. Visualize it
3. Share it (public or privately)

(you can even stop at #2, sharing is not mandatory, you may create a visualization to better understand your own data)

CartoDB lets you easily import your data in many different formats (Excel, CSV, XML, SHP...) and from different sources (your hard disk, Google Drive, Dropbox...), and makes it plain easy to show it on a map it using our visual wizards. With our wizards you can select what type of visualization you want to create, and you can define legends and infowindows (contextual modal windows associated with a data point or area) and select which information from your database you want to show. 

After you have created your visualization with our web interface, you can keep it private, share it with our colleagues, or publish it to the web, sharing its own URL or embeding it in your blog or CMS. 

In this guide we'll show you all features and posibilities from the CartoDB web interface (if you are ready to mess up with our powerful APIs, go check [CartoDB.js][cartodb_js] and [SQL API][sql_api])
