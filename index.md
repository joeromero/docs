Have you been roaming the internet in search of a tool that will let you make the wild maps in your imagination? Maybe you have grown weary of all the headaches that can come with geospatial data processing? Or perhaps you are new to mapping and are looking for something easy to learn but unlimited in potential? You're in luck, we are here to team up with you to make those and the many other challenges of online mapping fade into a distant memory. 

## What is CartoDB?

At its heart, CartoDB is an open source geospatial Mapping Platform. It is a tool we built to make mapping dynamic, scalable, and interesting. Wrapped around its core, CartoDB is a Mapping Tool that gives you a user friendly interface so you can start making maps and visualizing data right away. The combination of the two give you some of the most powerful mapping resources you'll ever experience. It's like Secretariat, Frank Lloyd Wright, and John Lennon had started a cartography club. 

Below, we'll split our introduction into those two parts, the Mapping Platform and the Mapping Tool. If you are looking for a scalable geospatial system to build tools or power your applications, jump down to the [Mapping Platform]() section. If you are looking for a drag & drop interface where you can style and customize maps in minutes, head to the [Mapping Tool]() section. If you want both, keep reading, it's all right here waiting for you!

### Mapping Tool

So we hear you've been out there trying different mapping tools on your computer and on the web. I bet most of them look a bit stuck in 2004, right? That probably concerns you because if a tool looks stuck in 2004 you can only *imagine* what the maps it produces look like. When we started CartoDB a few years ago this was a major challenge we set out to fix. We built the tool from the ground-up with beautiful design and good user-experience at the top of guiding principles. What you see on the surface doesn't stop there, we make the same effort to ensure that the maps you create are beautiful and easy to use.

The CartoDB interface allows you to drag & drop geospatial data (e.g. CSVs, ESRI Shapefiles, etc.) onto your browser and have an interactive map in seconds. There is no download or installation needed. With your data and maps in hand, you can quickly filter, customize looks, and publish maps on the web. The tool gives you simple interfaces for publishing maps as public URLs, password protected visualizations for collaborations, embeddable maps, or even API endpoints to build CartoDB delivered maps directly into your own websites. 

Some of the best parts of the Mapping Tool are the parts that you might never even notice. One example is scalablility. Use CartoDB to design and publish a map on your website in minutes, great. Today maybe you will have one visitor, but what about tomorrow when your page makes it to #1 on Reddit? CartoDB will scale with you, helping to make sure get to enjoy the fruit of your labor. Jump in and start using the tool right now, we have free accounts for you to try out and we have lots of great resources, including an awesome [community of users](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cartodb) out there to help get your questions answered quick!

### Mapping Platform

Okay, beautiful maps and intuitive interface got you hooked, but now you want to build something a bit more complex? That is where the Mapping Platform comes in. It is what backs the Mapping Tool, so if you've made a map, you've already been using it. CartoDB runs on an open source stack including PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and a host of other powerful and scalable components. The Mapping Platform wraps together your database with Map and SQL APIs that let you interact with data remotely. Using the CartoDB service also means you can take advantage of the most secure and up to date libraries at all times, no more fuss. 

Speaking of fuss, CartoDB also makes it easy to upload, update, and manage geospatial data in real-time. Because CartoDB runs on a live relational database, it means you can update your data and see those changes in real-time. Building a mobile data-collection tool and want to see the results? Done. Trying to build the next-generation dashboard for the city of the future? Done. Monitoring real-time vehicle location? Done. CartoDB is fast, scalable, and flexible to fit your needs. In combination with the Mapping Tool, it also gives you an environment that is great for prototyping new ideas and moving quickly with geospatial data.
